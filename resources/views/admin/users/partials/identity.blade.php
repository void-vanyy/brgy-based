{{--
    The name/avatar cell of a user row: initials, e-mail, the "You" badge and
    purok. Rendered by the board on first load and by UserController after an
    ajax role/status save, because the avatar colour is derived from the role
    and would otherwise disagree with the badge next to it.

    Contents only - the row wraps them in a <td data-identity-cell>.
